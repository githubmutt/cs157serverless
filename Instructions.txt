LAB DESCRIPTION
=================
An Employee Management system/portal is a typical component any medium
to large organization. It typically consists of a system that accesses
a database that holds information about employees. The employee management
app in this lab allows a user to list, create, modify and delete employee
records using an intuitive user interface (CRUD operations).

Your job is to build the CRUD API endpoints using Express that will allow
the front-end to function. The front-end and some of the server-side has
already been done for you therefore, there's no need to modify any of the
existing HTML/code on the client (index.html and script.js).

You will need to use API testing tool to test/debug your endpoint. All
details for each endpoint and validation you need to perform on the data
will be included in the comments for each endpoint.

============
INSTRUCTIONS
============
1. Fork this project to your REPL.it account

2. Follow the instructions included as comments beginning on Part 0
   in the index.js file. Test your endpoints using a testing tool such
   as req bin. This will significantly reduce your debugging time.
